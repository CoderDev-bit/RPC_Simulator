---The final output should be---
-a Java GUI program
-simulation of RPC where
-before game simulation, user chooses {
    strategies to be used for each player {
        RPC Strategies {
            Random (Nash equilibrium)
                Equal chance for all choices independent of any other stats
            Intuition

                Opening Move{
                    35.4% rock
                    35.0% paper
                    29.6% scissors
                }

                Not likely to repeat same choice more than 2x (third time they will likely choose what counter to the last move they chose)

                1. Winners repeat choices
                2. Losers choose the unpicked choice next round (or go backwards in S/W Diagram)
                    /or choose opponents choice (the choice that beat them)

            Reverse Cycling
                1. Winners choose the opponents choice next round (or go) /choose unpicked choice
                2. Losers choose the unpicked choice next round (or go backwards in S/W Diagram)


            Tiers choose randomly

            *Intuition choices are never absolutely certain (instead more LIKELY). Therefore, I
            likely have to determine the p(w) or r(p(w))
        }
    }


    what statistics they want to see {
        real-time stats {
            who won
            winner choice
            loser choice
            # of games played
        }

        Report {
            win count,
            win rate,
            overall winner,
            winning and losing streaks,
            win rate of a specific choice of a specific player
            # of games played
        }
    }
}
-during simulation, at regular intervals, sample of outcomes and RPC choices shown (who won and what were the choices)
-after game ends, produces detailed report that displays findings of simulation (chosen stats)
