---The final output should be---
-a Java GUI program
-simulation of RPC where
-before game simulation, user chooses {
    strategies to be used for each player {
        RPC Strategies {
            Random (Nash equilibrium)
                Equal chance for all choices independent of any other stats
            Intuition
                1. Winners repeat choices
                2. Losers choose the unpicked choice next round (or go backwards in S/W Diagram)
                    /or choose opponents choice (the choice that beat them)

            Reverse Cycling
                1. Winners choose the opponents choice next round (or go) /choose unpicked choice
                2. Losers choose the unpicked choice next round (or go backwards in S/W Diagram)


            Tiers choose randomly

            *Intuition choices are never absolutely certain (instead more LIKELY). Therefore, I
            likely have to determine the p(w) or r(p(w))

    }


    what statistics they want to see {
        real-time stats {
            who won
            winner choice
            loser choice
            # of games played
        }

        Report {
            win count,
            win rate,
            overall winner,
            winning and losing streaks,
            win rate of a specific choice of a specific player
            # of games played
        }
    }
}
-during simulation, at regular intervals, sample of outcomes and RPC choices shown (who won and what were the choices)
-after game ends, produces detailed report that displays findings of simulation (chosen stats)
