---The final output should be---
A Java GUI program
Simulation of RPC where user chooses what RPS simulations they would like to run
Showing sample of simulation outcomes in real time
Giving user choices to select what statistics they like to see, such as:

Who had more wins overall?
If one player chose rock, what was the winning percentage or experimental probability?
What was the winning, losing streak?
Etc.
