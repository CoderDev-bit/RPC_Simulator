-before game simulation, user chooses {
    strategies to be used for each player {

            Human intuition (Pavlov-based)

                Opening Move{
                    35.4% rock
                    35.0% paper

                Not likely to repeat same choice more than 2x (third time they will likely choose what counter to the last move they chose)

                1. Win (repeat most likely)
                    W0 = 0.57 ± 0.03
                    W− = 0.20 ± 0.02
                    W+ = 0.23 ± 0.02

                2. Tie (repeat most likely)
                    T0 = 0.56 ± 0.03
                    T− = 0.22 ± 0.02
                    T+ = 0.22 ± 0.02

                2. Losers choose the unpicked choice next round (or go backwards in S/W Diagram)
                    /or choose opponents choice (the choice that beat them)
                    L0 = 0.45 ± 0.03
                    L− = 0.30 ± 0.02
                    L+ = 0.25 ± 0.02

            Anti-Pavlov
                1. Winners choose the opponents choice next round (or go) /choose unpicked choice
                2. Losers choose the unpicked choice next round (or go backwards in S/W Diagram)


            Tiers choose randomly

            *Intuition choices are never absolutely certain (instead more LIKELY). Therefore, I
            likely have to determine the p(w) or r(p(w))

            winning and losing streaks,
            win rate of a specific choice of a specific player

-during simulation, at regular intervals, sample of outcomes and RPC choices shown (who won and what were the choices)
-after game ends, produces detailed report that displays findings of simulation (chosen stats)
