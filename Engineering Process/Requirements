RPC Strategies:
Random
    Equal chance for all choices independent of any other stats
Intuition
    1. Winners repeat choices
    2. Losers choose the unpicked choice next round (or go backwards in S/W Diagram)

Reverse Cycling
    1. Winners choose the opponents choice next round (or go)
    2. Losers choose the unpicked choice next round (or go backwards in S/W Diagram)

Tiers choose randomly

*Intuition choices are never absolutely certain (instead more LIKELY). Therefore, I
likely have to determine the p(w) or r(p(w))
